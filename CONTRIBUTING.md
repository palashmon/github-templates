# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the github-templates [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2.  Add new template.
3.  If you've changed a template, update the documentation.
4.  Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/palashmon/github-templates/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/palashmon/github-templates/issues/new) it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
